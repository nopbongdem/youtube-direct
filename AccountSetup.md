## YouTube and Google Account Setup ##

Before using YouTube Direct, there are several steps that you need to take related to YouTube accounts and API access.

## Steps ##

### Account Setup ###
  * If you do not have a YouTube account, visit http://youtube.com and follow the Create Account link to start the process of creating one. As part of the practice, you'll be asked to link the new YouTube account to a Google Account. You can either use an existing Google Account email address (e.g. any @gmail.com address) or create a new Google Account associated with any other email address. Whichever option you choose, make note of the Google Account email address and password that you use.
  * If you have an existing YouTube account, it will likely already be linked to a Google Account. Visit http://www.youtube.com/account#notifications/email and check which email address is associated with your YouTube account. Underneath the address, you should see "You signed in via Google..." indicating that the address is a Google Account.

### Registering a YouTube API Developer Key ###
Visit http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard/gwt/ and make sure that you are signed in with the Google Account from step 1. Click the New Product button and fill in the Name field with a descriptive name (the other fields are optional). Click Save, and a value will be generated for the Developer Key. Make note of this value; you'll need it later when configuring your YouTube Direct instance.
